# SimpleDapp
A Full Stack DApp created as part of my final test for Blockchain Silver Certification by PixelTests and IIT Madras

When I started with Blockchain development
I wanted a simple guide that would work for sure, without me having to reverse engineer stuff from here and there, look into documentations since my doubts weren't answered well enough and so on.
So here, I have created a text file manual to help people who are like me :)

Read through the Steps_To_SimpleDapp.txt file to find out information regarding the very basic yet fundamental elements required for the Decentralized Application (DApp) to be functional
It also provides you with a step by step instructional manual on how to get it running.

The guide is still in a raw form, Did not work on appearance and seamlessness since I don't know how many people are going to refer this. If you need any help, feel free to contact me.
