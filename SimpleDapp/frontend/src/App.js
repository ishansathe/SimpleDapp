//Just consider it as an object that you are using to implement whatever is inside the file

We have forsaken the App function long ago
We even export default as the Hello Message
But, in index.js file what is imported is 'App' from App.js
and <App /> is what is being rendered!

One mystery is how even now, after we uncomment the App function and try to display just it, the HelloMessage is displayed
Even after we set export default to App
